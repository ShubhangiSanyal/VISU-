Welcome to the 2nd component of the Visualization project!<br>
Here, I have created a Shiny interactive Dashboard that can be accessed directly through the link provided in `Link.md`<br>
If you want to check out the raw code behind the interactive dashboard, take a look at the shiny web app script uploaded in `app.R`<br>
Download the above file along with the dataset `concrete.csv` in the same directory and run it in your machine! <br>
(Don't forget to have R-studio installed in your device)
